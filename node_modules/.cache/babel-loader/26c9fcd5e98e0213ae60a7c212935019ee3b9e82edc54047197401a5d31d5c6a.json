Throughout\n          Highschool, I took Computer Science 1-3, AP computer science, Videogame\n          design, a Cisco Networking class, and computer programming\n          (in total 7 computer science related classes).\n          <br/><br/>\n          At Louisiana Tech I have taken classes such as Data Structures, Systems Programming,\n          Intro to Microprocessors, Computer Network Security, Applied Cryptography, and many more.\n          All of these classes have allowed me to grow my critical skill set, and I am ready to use\n          the skills that I have accumulated in a professional work environment.\n          <br/><br/>\n          I have experience in many languages, but the language that I am most comfortable with is\n          Python. Other languages that I have used include Java, C, C++, and JS. I am able to pickup languages\n          relatively quickly. I am currently learning Web development with the REACT framework along with VUE and MUI -->\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"AboutMe\",\n};\n</script>\n\n\n<style scoped>\n.helloWorld{\n  align-content: left;\n  justify-content: left;\n  text-align: left;\n  color:aquamarine;\n}\n.myName{\n  align-content: left;\n  justify-content: left;\n  text-align: left;\n  color: #10c55c;\n  font-size: 500%;\n}\n.holder{\n  margin: 4rem;\n  margin-right: 4rem;\n  margin-left: 4rem;\n  min-height: 80vh;\n  height: auto;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  background-color: #08355a;\n  border-radius: 1rem;\n}\n.aboutMe {\n  color: #ffffff;\n  align-content: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  text-align: center;\n  margin: 3rem;\n}\n.shortDescription{\n  margin: 4.5rem;\n  margin-top: 0rem;\n  width: 65vw;\n  height: 20rem;\n  text-align: left;\n}\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
