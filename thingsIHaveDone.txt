Engineering class
        making a small robot<br>
                My freshman year at Louisiana Tech I created a robot using an Arduino.<br> 
                The goal was to create a robot that moved plastic figures around a obstacle course.<br>
                I did this by coding the arduino to do each of the tasks. I was one of the only people<br>
                in my class to figure out how to use a photoresistor to follow a dark line on the course,<br>
                and stop at a specified goal area.  

        making a self regulating fishtank<br>
                I, along with the help of 2 other groupmates, created and coded a fishtank that regulated<br>
                the temperature and salinity using a thermoresistor and an apparratus that used the water<br> 
                as a resistor, and calculated the salinity using the voltage that was read across the resistor<br><br>

        making a set of automatic blinds<br>
                For my final engineering project, I created a set of automatic blinds that opened and closed<br>
                based on how bright it was outside, and the time of the day.
