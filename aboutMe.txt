&emsp;My name is Aankit Pokhrel, I am currently a Cyber engineering major at Louisiana Tech University<br>
I was born in Nepal, and my father, mother and I moved hear in 2003 when I was just 2 years old. My family <br>
owns 4 gas stations and manages 3 of them. Originally my plan was to go to medical school and become a doctor<br>
but the medicine class that I took my sophomore year of highschool had other plans, I didn't find anything in<br>
that class interesting, I had taken a computer science class my freshman year, and I liked it alot. I got more<br>
into computer science, and even helped one of my teachers previous students make an encoder that used modular<br>
math (I used Java). all throughout Highschool, I took Computer Science 1-3, AP computer science, Videogame design,<br>
a Cisco Networking class, and computer programming (in total 7 computer science related classes). 
 
&emsp;The languages that I can code in are Python and Java, and have worked with Arduinos, basys 3 boards, and <br>
constantly use ZSHELL on my linux computer (currently using Parrot OS becuse of the penetration testing tools)<br>
Although this may not seem like much, I am quick learner, and can get used to any language quickly. In my university<br>
classes I've had to use languages that I have never touched, such as C and I got used to it quickly.
